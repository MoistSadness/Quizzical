# Quizzical
I created this app as the final project for the Free Code Camp React course. We were basiclly given a Figma document and were told to go and finish it out our own with no help. I thought it was a cool little project so I gave it it's own repository so I can deploy it on the internet via Netlify for everyone to see. There were a couple things this project is supposed to demonstrate:
 - Usage of APIs to create an application
 - Practical usage of state and updating it when changes are made
 - Using CSS to style it

Since some time has passed since I first created the application, I decided to make some adjustments:
 - I fixed the hover issue where hovering over an answer would change the pointer to a text selection cursor instead of a pointer
 - Changed the tooling to use Vite instead of CRA since CRA is apparently dead now. 

### Happy Quizzing, folks!
